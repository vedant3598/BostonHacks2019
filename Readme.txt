# BostonHacks 2019 - GNome
This is a project I developed with three of my colleagues at BostonHacks. We developed an in-home nurse assistant that 
keeps track of a patient's symptoms and also reminds the patient to take their medicine. It also helps to schedule appointments with doctors by sending them an email to book an appointment. This was developed through VoiceFlow, HTML, and CSS. It was a winner 
for the *Best Domain Name* sponsored by MLH.
